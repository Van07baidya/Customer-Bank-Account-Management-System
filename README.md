The system is designed as an interactive and content management system. The content management system deals with data entry and updating transaction logs while the interactive system deals with system interaction with the files. Thus, above features of this project will save transaction time and therefore increase the efficiency of the system

# Getting Started
Give execution permission to the program file using:

chmod +x project.sh

Run the file using:

./project.sh

On running, the program asks user to enter transaction type, i.e. debit/credit. The required type needs to be entered after which the amount of money to be transacted is to be provided. After entering recipient/senderâ€™s name, the account type is to be entered. The date of transaction to be provided is optional. If not provided, the current date is taken into consideration.
The required transactions are performed in the given account type and a transaction log is appended to the transaction file. Finally, the net account balance details are printed.
